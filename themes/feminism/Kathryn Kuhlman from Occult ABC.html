    <p><b>In these chaotic days, we have not only the right but the duty totest
        every movement by the standard of the Holy Scriptures. In particular,

    </p>
    <p>We have no right to judge:</p>
    <p>"Judge not, that ye be not judged" (Matthew 7:1).

    </p>
    <p>Kathryn Kuhlman was a healer who drew large crowds to her
      meetings.Millions came to her for help. Her meetings were attended by up
      to ten
      thousand at a time.</p>
    <p>Kathryn was born in Concordia, sixty miles from Kansas City. Her mother
      was a Methodist, her father a Baptist. As a young girl, she went to a
      Baptistseminary and was ordained as a Baptist preacher. Her first church
      was in
      Franklin, Pennsylvania. One day some people in her congregation said
      thatthey had been healed while she was preaching. Kathryn was astonished.
      When
      such occurrences became more frequent, she began to preach about
      faithhealing, without ceasing to put the main emphasis on the salvation of
      the
      soul. Before long, she moved from Franklin to the great city of
      Pittsburgh,where ever-increasing crowds flocked to her services. From
      1946, she conducted
      an average of 125 healing meetings per year. She used the largest hallsin
      the USA, and her healing meetings were attended by about one and a half
      million people each year. This figure is given by a doctor named
      WilliamNolen.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the meetings, she appeared on many radio and TV
      programs.The huge sums of money given as offerings have been used for
      building twenty-five
      churches, many schools and homes, and for social projects of many kinds.</p>
    <p>It is a thankless, but necessary, task to subject the healing work of
      this woman to the test of the Scriptures. I will do so in such a way asto
      allow as many other observers as possible to have their say.
    </p>
    <p>The background of my views is the material I collected during many
      lecturetours in the USA. At the time of writing, I have been there
      thirty-four
      times for tours. I have read Miss Kuhlman's books, I have attended a
      four-hourhealing meeting at the First Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh;
      and I have
      had a personal conversation with her. I also have many verbal and
      writtenreports from people who attended her meetings.
    </p>
    <p>At this point, I must thank most warmly my two principal informants.Mrs.
      H. Maynard Johnson, wife of the technical director of the Eifel Hospital
      in Minneapolis, collected twenty-eight cases of healing, with full
      addresses,from Minneapolis and the surrounding area for me. I also
      received an excellent,
      scientifically based article from Dr. H. H. Ehrenstein of Songtime
      Boston.Names of further assistants will appear in the course of the
      chapter.
    </p>
    <p>First of all, I must give a brief sketch of the style of these
      healingmeetings. After a fantastic organ prelude, Kathryn would appear on
      the
      stage dressed in a long blue or white robe. Everyone would stand up.
      Shewould say: "How glad I am to have you all here. The Holy Spirit will
      perform
      a great work among you." The atmosphere was heightened by an
      introductoryhymn sung by thousands of expectant people. This was followed
      by prayer
      and a short sermon. Then Kathryn would suddenly announce, "Up there inthe
      second row of the balcony a man has just been healed of cancer. Please
      come down to the platform," or "a girl in the seventeenth row has justbeen
      healed of a lung disease." It would continue in the same way for several
      hours. The people who had been healed came to the platform. Kathryn
      wouldhold her hands about six inches above the head of each and pray. They
      then
      would fall backwards to the floor. Two attendants would catch them as
      theyfell, so they would not hurt themselves. The people who had been
      healed
      would lay for ten to thirty seconds unconscious on the floor. When
      theystood up, they would say that they had a wonderful feeling. While I
      was
      watching, I saw even ministers falling to the floor unconscious, one
      ofthem a Catholic priest.
    </p>
    <p>Kathryn would then ask those who had been healed one or two
      questions,different every time. For instance, she asked a woman in her
      fifties, "Do
      you believe in Jesus?" "No, I am a Buddhist." A young man about
      twentyyears old was asked: "Are you a Christian?" "No, I am an atheist."
      "Won't
      you believe in Jesus now that He has healed your wife?" Kathryn asked.A
      long silence passed. After much pressing on Kathryn's part, he finally
      said, "I will try."</p>
    <p>Many people have tussled with the question of how it was that Kathryn
      could tell which person had been healed of which disease. Many
      doctorsinvestigated this problem and came up with various answers. Was it
      clairvoyance
      or mediumistic contact?</p>
    <p>The next question is, Did healing really take place, and did it last?
    </p>
    <p>Another question relates to the spiritual aspect of these heaings. Didthe
      people who had been healed find the way to Jesus, and if they were
      Christians already, was any harm done to their faith?</p>
    <p>A sensational aspect was the way those who had been healed fell
      backwards.
      What powers were involved? Was it hypnosis? Kathryn's friends called
      suchpeople the slain of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>Let us now call some witnesses. Since I am one of them, I will firstgive
      three of my experiences.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 105</b> At the healing meeting in Pittsburgh a woman doctor brought
      a woman on to the stage. The doctor gave the following report: "This
      womanhad multiple sclerosis in an advanced stage. She used to wear two
      splints
      and was almost blind. Her abdomen was partially paralyzed. She had a
      permanentcatheter for three years. Three months ago I went with the
      patient to one
      of Kathryn Kuhlman's meetings. The patient was healed. Since then she
      hasneeded neither splints nor catheter. The paralysis has disappeared. She
      is now a nurse in the hospital in which she used to be a patient."</p>
    <p>There is no reason to doubt the truthfulness of this testimony. We know,
      of course, that the fact of healing gives us no indication of what powerit
      was that brought it about.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 106</b> My second example shows a spiritual situation. I met a
      man at the meeting who allowed me to ask him some questions. He was
      verywilling to answer them. "Have you experienced healing?" "Yes, thirteen
      years ago I was healed at Kathryn's meeting." "Do you belong to Jesus?Do
      you pray and read the Bible?" "Yes, I follow Jesus and know Him as my
      Lord and Savior." "Has your healing lasted?" "Yes, for thirteen
      years."This is another testimony that I cannot simply dismiss.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 107</b> A third experience made me begin to have doubts. It was
      during a personal interview with Kathryn. She suddenly began to pray
      withme. She held her hands about six inches above my head. At once I began
      to pray in my heart, <b>"Lord Jesus, if this woman gets her power from
        You, then bless both her and me. If she has gifts and power which do
        notcome from You, protect me from them. I do not want to come under an
        alien
        influence."</b> While Kathryn was praying, two ushers came and stood
      behind
      me to catch me as I fell. I felt nothing, however, and stood like a
      rockwithout losing my consciousness in the least. Then came a second
      surprise.
      Kathryn nudged me gently, probably in order to make me fall. She did
      notsucceed. Then she asked me, "Do you have a healing ministry yourself?"
      I answered, "In my pastoral counseling it has happened occasionally,
      butthat is not my calling: my task is to preach the Gospel and bring
      people
      to salvation."</p>
    <p>Since this experience, I have for years kept my eyes and ears open to
      try to discover the truth behind these enormous healing demonstrations.</p>
    <p>There is a problem about the experience of the man who was healed
      thirteen
      years ago and yet has suffered no ill effects in his spiritual life. Onthe
      assumption that Kathryn did not heal by divine power, as thousands
      of people believe, would it be possible for a person who had been healedin
      such a way to suffer no spiritual harm? I have enough examples front
      counseling people in similar situations to be able to say yes.</p>
    <p><b>Ex 108</b> A German architect told me that he had found the way to
      Jesus through the preaching of a minister who was a drunkard. The
      ministerwas often drunk, but when he was sober, his preaching was sound.
      God can
      bring people to new life even by means of unworthy witnesses.</p>
    <p><b>Ex 109</b> I have heard of several believers who have found the way
      of salvation through the ministry of a charlatan who taught
      unscripturaldoctrines. I shall not mention this man by name, although he
      has done much
      harm.</p>
    <p>The next witness we must call is Mrs. H. Maynard Johnson, whom I
      mentioned
      above, the lady front Minneapolis who has provided me with so much
      usefulmaterial. The reports she sent to me are of great evidential value,
      since
      they describe the situation one year after the healing took place. I
      willbegin with Mrs. Johnson's own experience, in her own words, but
      shortened.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 110</b> "My husband, daughter, and I went to see and hear Miss
      Kuhlman and pray that I might be healed of what my doctor had just toldme
      could be the first stages of rheumatoid arthritis. I had been having
      pains in my joints, especially in my fingers and wrists. I have been
      forcedto give up my hobbies of sewing and organ playing. Writing had
      become painful
      also. During Miss Kuhlman's healing service, she spoke from the stage
      sayingthat someone seated in our section was receiving a healing of
      arthritis.
      My arms went up over my head, and I began wiggling all my fingers and
      therewas no pain. One of her helpers stopped at our row and told me to
      come
      with her to the front. As I approached Miss Kuhlman, she asked what I
      hadbeen healed of; then she lightly touched my forehead with her finger
      tips,
      as she called out to God to remove the arthritis from my body. At
      thatinstant I was slain in the Spirit. I felt completely separated from my
      surroundings, as a beautiful peace went all through me. As we left
      theauditorium that day, I told my family, "If the physical healing wasn't
      meant to last, I know my spiritual healing will never leave me." A
      yearlater I can still make that statement: the physical healing has
      lasted,
      too. The day after the service, I was scheduled to go to the clinic tohave
      extensive blood work done. My blood tests showed that I was not only
      normal, but better than normal. I have witnessed to many people
      regardingthis marvelous healing of my body and spirit. My whole life
      direction has
      changed since this happened to me. My prayer life took on new meaning.My
      hunger for the Word has greatly increased. I continue to spread the
      word as to how great it is when we let God take complete control."</p>
    <p>Because I am very grateful to Mrs. Johnson for the twenty-eight case
      histories she has so carefully reported for me, I might be tempted to
      keepmy own views to myself. But this case also raises a number of
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>1. In cases of arthritis, the psyche and psychosomatic connections
      oftenplay a part. Healings from arthritis head the list of all healings by
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>2. I cannot accept this phenomenon of being slain in the Spirit as awork
      of the Holy Spirit. When people fall to the ground in the course of
      a spiritual revival, in repentance and sorrow for sin, weeping over
      theirsins and asking for God for forgiveness, it is quite a different
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>3. What are we to make of Mrs. Johnson's reference to a spiritual
      healingwhich would still be there even if the physical healing should
      disappear?
      The expression spiritual healing is used by many spiritist healers.
      Theonly kind of spiritual healing the Bible knows is the process of
      conversion
      and regeneration. Mrs. Johnson was already a believing Christian when
      shewent to the meeting. There is no such thing as a second rebirth. This
      so-called
      spiritual healing does not make sense and could be compared with what
      isknown in extreme circles as the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>Lack of space unfortunately forbids me to discuss all twenty-eight
      healingsin detail, interesting as that would be. I will here record the
      general
      conclusion.</p>
    <p>One year after meeting with Kathryn, the state of all twenty-eight people
      said by her to have been healed was as follows: Ten had not been
      healed,seven had experienced an improvement in their condition, eleven had
      diseases
      in which the mind can play an important part. <b>In the whole of this
        extensive
        report, there is not one clear case of healing from an organic disease.</b>
      So for all the trouble taken by Mrs. Johnson, for which I thank her
      again,nothing has been proved.
    </p>
    <p>A further witness is a woman who worked for two years as secretary
      toKathryn Kuhlman. She followed me and caught up with me at the airport of
      a great American city. In a conversation, she told me that for two
      yearsshe had recorded the addresses of those who had been healed, and had
      later
      made inquiries as to their condition. Seventy-five percent of those onthe
      register had remained well.
    </p>
    <p>What value can we place on these figures?</p>
    <p>1. In the first place, it is her job as secretary to represent her
      employer.
      Does this not prejudice objectivity?</p>
    <p>2. Her journey after me was quite clearly undertaken with the object
      of conveying a good impression of the healings.</p>
    <p>3. It is obvious that this woman does not possess the necessary knowledge
      of medicine and psychology to enable her to assess the nature of the
      healings.</p>
    <p>4. Healing is a field in which it is hard to get a clear, overall view.
      It may occur as a result of suggestion, hypnosis, mediumistic, or
      occultpowers, but it can also have a sound medical or Biblical basis.
    </p>
    <p>This assessment of the figures she gave me is not an attack on the
      integrityof the lady in question. I formed a very good impression of her
      as I did
      of Mrs. Johnson.</p>
    <p>In the spring of 1974, there was a "charismatic" congress in Jerusalem
      under the title of "The Holy Spirit". Kathryn Kuhlman took part. Six
      monthsafter this world conference of Pentecostal churches, I received a
      letter
      from a lady working with the Finnish Missionary Society in Jerusalem.
      Itwas about Kathryn Kuhlman.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 111</b>
    </p>
    <p>Jerusalem Sept. 17, 1974</p>
    <p>Dear Dr. Koch,
    </p>
    <p>"I write because I don't know anybody else who could answer my questions.</p>
    <p>"I have read Kathryn Kuhlman's book, God Can Do It Again and was
      positively
      impressed. When K. K. came to Jerusalem last spring ( 1974), I went toher
      miracle service with great expectation. At the first meeting I felt
      happy, but afterwards I started to doubt.</p>
    <p>"1. How could she know when a person was healed?
    </p>
    <p>"2. With whose power was the healing done?</p>
    <p>"3. Why did the healed people fall on the floor, when she prayed for
      them?</p>
    <p>"I went to a second meeting and tried to pray the whole time, but also
      to watch carefully. After the healing service, K. K. left the platform,and
      went through the crowd standing in the big hall. Suddenly I felt an
      oppression and a fear that she should touch me. I closed my eyes, liftedmy
      arms and prayed in Jesus' name that God would help me. When K. K. passed
      in the place where I stood, she gripped my right arm very strongly fora
      moment. Nothing happened. After a while, I felt strong power, like
      electricity,
      above me, I felt like I was going to die. My arms were paralyzed and
      Icouldn't take them down immediately. Since then I have felt a big
      difficulty
      to believe that her power is from God. I have just finished K. K.'s
      secondbook, "I Believe in Miracles". It seems to me very good and I can
      not understand
      why she gave me another impression.</p>
    <p>"I can't get rid of my doubts alone, and they have not ceased to disturb
      me spiritually.</p>
    <p>"If you understand this and could answer me in spite of your huge burden
      of work, I would be extremely thankful."</p>
    <p>This Finnish missionary is not alone in her experience. Others, myself
      included, have noticed the difference between the books and the
      person.Often people have told me that, by praying continuously through a
      meeting,
      they have become aware of an unscriptural atmosphere. It is possible
      eventhen for subjective elements to become mixed with objective
      assessment.
    </p>
    <p>Vim Malgo goes into the question of the "World Congress on the
      HolySpirit" in Jerusalem. Four unscriptural points come out in this
      report.
    </p>
    <p>1. The Holy Spirit was the central theme. The Holy Spirit does not
      allowhimself to be given a central place; the Holy Spirit makes Jesus
      central
      (John 16:13).</p>
    <p>2. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is identical with regeneration. A
      child of God is filled (Ephesians 5:18) ever more deeply with the
      HolySpirit, according to his faithful obedience.
    </p>
    <p>3. The Holy Spirit does not allow himself to be the main person.
      Jesussays in John 16:14, "He will glorify me."
    </p>
    <p>4. Finally, it was an ecumenical congress at which all shades of
      opinionwere represented .
    </p>
    <p>Vim Malgo's conclusion is that it was not the Holy Spirit who was atwork,
      but other spirits. <b>The so-called baptism of the Spirit is usually
        a baptism with spirits.</b>
    </p>
    <p>Malgo says: "The spirits find one another." In English we have the
      saying,"Birds of a feather flock together." It is therefore characteristic
      that
      Kathryn Kuhlman was one of the main speakers and drew the largest numberof
      hearers. This point has troubled me more and more over the years: <b>Kathryn
accepted
        invitations from wild extremists and stood on the same platformwith
        them.</b>
    </p>
    <p>There is a long report about Kathryn Kuhlman's appearances in
      Vancouverand Seattle. Lack of space again compels me to mention only the
      main points.
      This observer writes, "Kathryn Kuhlman calls herself an instrument of
      theLord. In reality, she is a medium of the lord of this world. <b>A
        person
        cannot receive a second birth from the Holy Spirit when someone
        toucheshis face and says a few words to him. </b>I believe in the
      charismata gifts
      of the Spirit. But what Kathryn Kuhlman displays is not a gift of the
      HolySpirit of God, but a gift of the spirits who rule in the air. These
      spirits
      make use of her, herself deceived and deceiving others ... She is a
      mediumof Satan."
    </p>
    <p>Another who writes in similar vein is a well-known professor of
      theologyat the University of Tubingen who has the reputation among
      believers of
      being a born-again Christian. This professor wrote to me, "Kathryn
      Kuhlmanis a spiritist. Twenty years ago you would have said so yourself."
    </p>
    <p>Certainly I would never make such a harsh judgment without careful
      investigation.We must think and speak well of a person, as long as he has
      not shown himself
      to be evil.</p>
    <p>The most scientific assessment is the report Dr. Ebrenstein of the USA
      has sent me. The article, which appeared in a Christian magazine, is
      entitled"In Search of a Miracle." It is written by a doctor and surgeon
      from Minneapolis,
      Dr. Nolen, who also has a good name as a Christian.</p>
    <p>Dr. Nolen had the addresses and telephone numbers of eighty-two people
      in Minneapolis sent to him. These people had been to the Kuhlman
      meetingand had been said to be healed. Some of them were sufferers from
      cancer,
      multiple sclerosis, and other diseases. Dr. Nolen followed up those whohad
      been healed in order to get an accurate picture of the whole story.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 112 </b>Before the beginning of a meeting, the doctor was standing
      near the elevator in which about 100 patients in wheelchairs were
      beingtaken up in turns. Among them was a man without a wheelchair who was
      limping
      very badly. The doctor asked him, "You find it painful to walk?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I had an operation two years ago. But it did not heal. So now
      I am hoping that Kathryn Kuhlman will heal me."</p>
    <p>"Shall I get you a wheelchair?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, that would be nice of you."</p>
    <p>The doctor brought the lame man a wheelchair, in which he was taken
      into the auditorium. During the meeting Kathryn called out into the
      hall,"There's a man here with cancer in his hip. You're cured. Your pain
      is
      gone. Come down and claim your cure."</p>
    <p>The man in the wheelchair was embarrassed at the idea of being pushed
      forward to the platform in a wheelchair. So he stood up and walked
      slowlydown the aisle. Behind him came one of the ushers, pushing his
      wheelchair.
      The doctor watched carefully. It was the man for whom he had borrowed
      thechair. When he reached the stage, Kathryn Kuhlman asked him,
    </p>
    <p>"Whose wheelchair is that? Not yours surely?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, it is," said the man. He did not want to give a long explanation.
      . Kathryn continued,</p>
    <p>"You've had cancer in the hip and now your pain is gone. Is that right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes," he answered.</p>
    <p>"Bend over so everyone can see." He bent over. "Walk around." He walked
      around. "Isn't the Holy Spirit wonderful?" she cried. A sound Of
      rejoicingwent round the hall.
    </p>
    <p><b>Afterward, the doctor inquired of this man. Nothing had changed inhis
        condition. But in Christian circles, the news was spread everywhere
        that a man in a wheelchair had been healed.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>Ex 113</b> Another case, that Dr. Nolen followed up, was that of
      a woman who was said to have been cured of lung cancer. In his own
      words,"When I contacted her, Leona told me that she had not had lung
      cancer at
      all. 'I have Hodgkin's disease,' she said, land some of the glands in
      mychest are involved. But since no one else got up when Miss Kuhlman said
      that someone with lung cancer is being cured, I figured it had to be me.<b>I've
been
        back to my doctor and he says he can't see any change in my x-ray.</b>
      I think I breathe better, but it's hard to tell, since I never had
      muchtrouble breathing anyway.' "
    </p>
    <p><b>Dr. Nolen also obtained from Kathryn Kuhlman a list of eight peoplewho
        were alleged to have been cured of cancer. Again the result of his
        investigations was completely negative.</b>
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Nolen comments,</p>
    <p>The more I learned of the results of Kathryn Kuhlman's miracle service,
      the more doubtful I became that any good she was doing could possibly
      outweighthe misery she was causing ... I don't believe she is a liar or a
      charlatan
      or that she is, consciously, dishonest ... I think she sincerely
      believesthat the thousands of sick people who come to her services and
      claim cures
      are, through her ministrations, being cured of organic diseases ...
      Theproblem is - and I'm sorry this has to be so blunt - one of ignorance.
      Miss Kuhlman doesn't know the difference between psychogenic and
      organicdiseases. Though she uses hypnotic techniques, she doesn't know
      anything
      about hypnotism and the power of suggestion. She doesn't know
      anythingabout the autonomic nervous system. Or, if she does know something
      about
      these things, she has certainly learned to hide her knowledge.</p>
    <p>Dr. Nolen's report, which I have reproduced here in a shortened form,
      does not answer all the questions raised by these strange healings.
      Inparticular, he does not deal with the falling backwards of the patients
      or he simply calls it hypnosis. Such an explanation is inadequate. <b>Doctors,
ministers,
        and strong-willed people cannot be laid out on the floor, asif they had
        been knocked out by hypnosis. Here other powers are involved.</b>
      Again, the sometimes accurate indication of the place where the
      patientsare sitting and of the nature of their diseases sounds remarkably
      like
      psychic contact.</p>
    <p>It will be held against me that at first I spoke favorably of her. I
      have already answered this objection. We ought to maintain a positive
      judgmentabout a person until he has given proof to the contrary. During
      the four
      years since that first meeting, I have received a great deal of
      material.This has resulted in a different impression from the one which I
      formed
      at first.</p>
    <p>In any case, Kathryn Kuhlman stands or falls before her Lord. Jesus
      has the last word about her and her work, and not we shortsighted men.We
      have the duty to test her work and to keep the Church of Christ informed.
      Let us take care that our work is able to stand in the eyes of the
      Lord.When King David saw his own guilt in the light of God, he sighed:
      "For
      mine iniquities are gone over my head: as an heavy burden they are
      tooheavy for me" (Psalms 38:4). <b>When we recognize our own guilt, the
        desire
        to cast stones goes away. Nevertheless, we are not spared the
        necessaryduty of acting as signposts to the Church of Christ, even when
        this means
        great heartache.</b>
    </p>
    <p>And it should be obvious from this chapter that it gives me no joy tohave
      to write about Kathryn Kuhlman. We might add this biographical note:
      Kathryn Kuhlman died on February 20, 1976.</p>
