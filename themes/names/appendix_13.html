        <p>In this week's Torah portion, Lech L'cha , Abram's name is changed to Abraham as part of a new covenant with God, through circumcision. Later on, Sarai, his wife, becomes Sarah. How can we account for these changes?</p>
        <p>The name Abram, related perhaps to other ancient Near Eastern names of the nineteenth century B.C.E., such as Abiram or Abarama, meant either "Father [that is, God] is exalted" (from West Semitic rwm ) or "Father [that is, God] loves" (from Akkadian ramu ). The Bible explains the change in Abram's name by saying that Abraham will now become av hamon goyim, "father of a multitude of nations" (Genesis 17:5). With regard to Sarai, who becomes Sarah, we find no explanation at all (Genesis 17:15).</p>
        <p>Grammatically speaking, Sarai is an archaic form of Sarah. The Talmud, however, intimates that the change marks the end of her barrenness (Babylonian Talmud, Rosh HaShanah 16b). The midrash states that the change is made because until now she has been a princess to her own people, but from this point forward she becomes a princess to all humanity (cf. B'reishit Rabbah 47:1).</p>
        <p>The Bible often provides nongrammatical, popular etymologies using a "sounds-like" approach. The case of Abraham is one of them. Though the explanation is linguistically incorrect, the text points to the patriarch's new status in humanity. The Rabbis, on the other hand, try to solve the problem by saying that this is a notarikon, namely, "the system of abbreviation either by shortening the words or by writing only one letter of each word" (per Encyclopaedia Judaica ). So, for example, Rashi states that in the beginning, Abram is only the "father" of Aram, his birthplace, but now he becomes the father of all nations. This is achieved by adding the letter hei , the first letter of hamon, "multitude," to his name: Abram becomes Abra ha m. Regarding Sarah, Rashi adds that the final letter yod in Sarai was taken away from her and given to Joshua, when his own name was altered from Hosea (Rashi on Genesis 17:5). For Ibn Ezra, the letters aleph, bet, reish, hei, and mem stand for Abir ("the mighty one," that is, God), hamon, and goyim ("nations").</p>
