        <p>Etymology of the name Abraham</p>
        <p>The name Abraham is often reported to mean Father Of Many Nations but that's rather obviously incorrect. In Genesis 17:5, the Lord promises Abram that he would be the father of many nations — in Hebrew: אב המון גוים, 'ab hamon goyim — but that does not mean that Abram's new name, namely Abraham, means Father Of Many Nations. After all, when we name our dog Bob because "that seems like a good idea," we are surely not suggesting that Bob means "good idea," are we? And sure enough, upon any kind of preliminary investigation it readily appears to anyone that the phrase 'ab hamon goyim is not remotely similar to our name Abraham. The phrase contains no "r", for instance, while our name does.</p>
        <p>God changes Abram's name to Abraham. Likewise, the Lord promises that Abraham's half-sister and wife Sarai would "become nations" or rather: "become international" (היתה לגוים, heyata le'goyim) and changed her name to Sarah (17:16). As with our name Abraham, the phrase does not relate to the name.</p>
        <p>The name Abraham (אברהם) follows from the name Abram (אברם) by inserting the letter ה (he) in front of the final ם (mem), and the name Sarah (שרה) follows from Sarai (שרי) by replacing the final י (yod) with the same letter ה (he).</p>
        <p>This letter ה (he) is one of a few Hebrew letters that may represent both a consonant and a vowel, and the Hebrew invention of vowel notation lifted the art of writing out of the realm of the esoteric and made it available to the common man (Exodus 19:6). This newly invented Instrument of Mass Synchronization is probably why the Semites gained the upper hand over Egypt and it's probably no coincidence that the name of the Lord, יהוה or YHWH consists of only those vowel-consonant symbols, and contains twice this potent letter ה (he). The form יו (Yu) — that is YHWH without the ה (he) — would thus be on a par with the names Abram and Sarai, and the existence of compound names like Joab (יואב) and Jochebed (יוכבד) demonstrates that this shorter form was indeed used.</p>
        <p>The names Sarai and Sarah both stem from the root שרר (sarar), which possibly means to rule or to be strong. The final י (yod) of the original name Sarai suggests a possessive form: my strength or strength(s) of, whereas the new name Sarah reflects the general idea of ruling or being strong. The names Sarai and Sarah reflect the same core idea, but the form Sarai reflects locality and the form Sarah reflects universality.</p>
        <p>The same transition between locality and universality is reflected in the names Abram and Abraham, which are both based on the root אבר ('abar), meaning to be strong (or to be able to protect; see below). The name Abram consists of the root plus ם, which could be construed as the masculine third person plural pronominal suffix: their. The name Abraham consists of the same root but now followed by the independent masculine third person plural personal pronoun: הם, they or them. Like Sarai, the name Abram seems to denote a nation's private strength, whereas the name Abraham, like Sarah, reflects the strength that arises from synchronicity among states.</p>
        <p>The core of the name Abraham comes from the exquisite root אבר ('br):</br>
        <p>אבר</p>
        <p>The verb אבר ('br) means to be strong or firm, particularly in a defensive way (rather than offensive). The derived nouns אבר ('eber) and אברה ('ebra) refer to the pinion(s) that make up a bird's wings, which in turn means that the ancients saw avian wings as means to protect rather than to fly with (the signature trait of angels, hence, is not an ability to fly but a tendency to protect). The verb אבר ('abar) describes activities done with pinions, which is to fly or to protect. The adjective אביר ('abbir), meaning strong in a defensive way; protective.</p>
        <p>Abraham meaning</p>
        <p>The name Abraham means <b>Their Strength</b> or <b>Their Protection</b> and reflects the security that arises from synchronicity among states (see below).
        Another detail worthy of note is that the first and last letters of the name אברהם (Abraham) are often used as formatives that do not change the meaning of the core word. These two letters obviously aren't inconsequential formative letters in our name, but if we remove them anyway, what remains is ברה (bara), the assumed root of the noun ברית (berit), meaning covenant.</p>
        <p> The name Abraham is applied to only one man in the Bible: the famous son of Terah, who started out his life as Abram in Ur of the Chaldeans (Genesis 11:27) and ended it in Canaan, as the grandfather of Jacob, who became Israel.
        The literary function of the character of Abraham obviously far exceeds that of a historical figure (Matthew 22:32) and his patriarchy obviously has nothing to do with physical descent — that particular obsession came later, spawned by nationalism (Matthew 3:9). Abraham's patriarchy denotes a shared behavior (John 8:39) — what we moderns would call an -ism , in essence comparable to the patriarchies of Jabal and Jubal, the "fathers" of all who keep life stock, live in tents and play music (Genesis 4:20-21). Jabal and Jubal's physical lineage was cut short by Noah's flood and their patriarchies, like Abraham's, sum up activity and not physical descent.
        It's been famously said that Abraham believed YHWH (and he reckoned that as righteousness; Genesis 15:6). The key-verb is אמן ('aman), which does not denote simply accepting for true an otherwise unverified statement but rather an active upholding of a standard. Abraham's patriarchy is one of doing; an activity much more fundamental than any particular conviction.
        The Biblical narrative does not progress along a temporal axis (following time, like a modern story would) but along a complexity axis (from general to specific). Hence Adam marks the level that all living things have in common (Eve was the 'mother of all life', or in modern terms: the biosphere; Genesis 3:20, and the 'original sin' affected the whole of creation; Romans 8:22), and Noah marks the level of complexity at which the human mind is distinguished from animal behavior (hence 'they knew not until the flood came'; Matthew 24:39, also see 2 Peter 2:12 and Jude 1:10).
        The story of Abraham serves as ultimate result of the destruction of the tower of Babel. Abraham's story follows the tower's story directly (Genesis 11), as two sides of the same coin. The proverbial tower of Babel manifests the quintessential need of people to gather around an identifying center, whereas Abraham's story is characterized by a divergence away from local centralization. The tower of Babel marks the level of primary state formation and Abraham marks the beginning of international dialogue, the exchange of goods and ideas, and the "centralization" around universal rather than local convictions.
        In the New Testament, the tension between Abraham and the tower of Babel is playfully revisited in the relationship between Jesus (John 12:32) and Mary Magdalene (= Mary of God's Tower), whose signature deliverance from seven demons was not a new thing but rather based on a time honored dictum: compare Luke 8:2 to Proverbs 9:1, Exodus 2:16, Isaiah 4:1 and even Revelation 1:4.</p>
